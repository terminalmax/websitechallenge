# Webdev Challenge #
This is a challenge I started with my friend. The goal is to make certain number of websites(a nice whole number, something like 100!) without a timelimit. (and learn HTML, CSS, JS in the process).

## The Plan ##
The initial few websites will be written purely in HTML, followed by HTML + CSS and then finally, HTML + CSS + JS. As the complexity of the websites increases, they'll be added to this repo as submodules. 

## List ##
This list will be updated with the Website title and a short description when a website is finished.

| No. | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1.  |       |             |
| 2.  |       |             |
